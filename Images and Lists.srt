1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that we have a text editor to work with,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
we're ready to dive into coding our HTML. Let's get started.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In our text editor, we're going to first set a few settings here

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
down in the bottom right corner.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to indent using spaces,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and I'm also going to set the tab with, or space with now, 

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to just 2 spaces.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is just my own personal preference,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and you can actually go ahead and set these to whatever you want.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, in our text editor, we're going to create a file and save it as index.html.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In Sublime Text 2, you can create a new file by simply opening Sublime Text.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're going to go ahead and on our Mac hit command S to save.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we'll call this &quot;index.html&quot; and click save.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The reason we called the &quot;index&quot; is because most webservers

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
will look for this file name and serve it as the first page that a visitor sees.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is often referred to as the homepage of your site.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We call it index, because it's usually an index or a listing of all the other things on the site.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The HTML extension is also important,

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
because when we open this file in a web browser,

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the web browser will know to render the HTML and apply special formatting 

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
rather than simply display the text as we see it in our editor.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go ahead and switch over to our web browser,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which in this case is Google Chrome.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We'll go ahead and open up our index.html file.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to open our finder window here,

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and I'll simply drag this onto Google Chrome to go ahead and open it.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now, at this point we should just be seeing a blank webpage,

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but pretty soon that'll change.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, in addition to our index.html file,

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we're also starting off with a folder of images that Allison has put together for us.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here we have a couple of icons, a few pictures of cupcakes,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
our &quot;Smells like Bakin'&quot; logo, some more pictures of cupcakes,

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
a Twitter icon, and another image of cupcakes.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We'll be using all of these to create our &quot;Smells like Bakin'&quot; webpage.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's start coding.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We'll switch over to Sublime Text, and first, we're going to start our webpage with a doc type.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We're going to open our angle bracket, type an exclamation point [ ! ], 

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
type the word DOCTYPE in all capital letters,

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
type the word html, and then close it.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Next, we need to open our HTML tag, and we'll go ahead and close that,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because everything is going to go inside of our HTML.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Next, we'll go ahead and open up a head tag, and we'll go ahead and close it,

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and then right below that in just a moment, we'll go ahead and create our body tag.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
First, however, there is a few things we need to put inside of our head tag.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What I'm going to type next is a little bit complicated.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll go ahead and type it first and then explain it.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's a lot going on here.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
First, we've created what's called a child element.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This tag is a child of its parent, which in this case is the head element.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a child, because it's nested inside between the opening head tag,

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and the closing head tag.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This system of nesting will become more natural to you as we move along,

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but it helps describe the relationship between elements.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Second, this element we just typed is called a meta-element,

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
often referred to as a meta-tag.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There are several types of meta-tags, 

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but in this case, we're using it to describe to the browser

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
what types of characters we'll be using.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This meta-tag is actually fairly technical,

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so my recommendation for beginners is to simply copy this line 

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
into the head section of your webpages exactly as you see it.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is a special element called a self-closing tag,

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because there's no ending tag that actually closes it.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It just closes itself.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Last, these parts inside of this particular meta-tag are called attributes.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
An attribute simply describes an element in more detail.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We'll learn about some more useful and common attributes

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
as we move along.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Next, we're going to type up a title.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We'll create an opening and closing title tag,

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and then inside we'll type &quot;Smells Like Bakin' Cupcake Company.&quot;

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The title appears at the top of every webpage.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go ahead and save that out.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We'll switch over to our web browser,

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and if you keep an eye on the tab title when I refresh the page,

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you'll see that it changes to &quot;Smells Like Bakin' Cupcake Company.&quot;

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now, let's stop for a minute and talk about web browsers.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The web browser I'm using is called Google Chrome.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can use another web browser if you'd like,

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
such as Firefox, or Safari.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sometimes web pages look slightly different depending on what web browser

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
they're being viewed in, but for these simpler web sites that we're working on,

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
any up-to-date browser should do just fine.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Remember, anytime you make a change to your text file,

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you want to make sure that you refresh it in your web browser 

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so you can actually see the changes.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's go back to our text file and keep working.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We're all done with our head tag for now,

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so let's go ahead and open up the body tag.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There's an open and closing body tag, 

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and that goes just below the head tag.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Notice that it is not nested inside like the title or meta-tags.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now, inside of our body element,

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
we're going to create an image.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll type this out first and then explain it.

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To create an image element, we just use img.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We don't actually type out the full word &quot;image.&quot;

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Next, we have a few attributes--src, or &quot;source,&quot; and alt, or &quot;alternate.&quot;

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The firs attribute, source, points to the location of an image file.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In this case, we have a folder called &quot;img&quot; and then inside of that folder

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
we have an image called logo with the file extension gif.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The second attribute is an alternate attribute.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
For search engines or for individuals with vision impairments

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that might not be able to see the image,

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
we can include text that describes what the image looks like,

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
or in this case, what our logo says.

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's go ahead and save this file.

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We'll see back to the browser and refresh the page,

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and as you can see, we now have our image in the webpage.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Next, we're going to create our navigation as a list of items.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There are a few list-types you can create in HTML,

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but the two basic ones are ordered lists 

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and unordered lists.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ordered lists are numbered, and we don't need that in this case,

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
so we'll go ahead and create an unordered list.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Switching back to our text editor,

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
just below our image here we'll go ahead and open up an unordered list

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:36,000
or a ul tag, and then we'll go ahead and close our unordered list.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Inside of our unordered list, we need to create a few list items.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, I know in advance that we're going to have four navigational elements.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go ahead and create four list items, using the li tag.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is going to be exactly the same for all these,

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so I'll just go ahead and copy and paste that three more times.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Inside of our li tag, we need to create some links

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
using what's called an anchor tag.

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We'll learn more about links later on, 

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but for now we're just creating a website that has one page.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
These links won't actually go anywhere.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We'll create a link for an about page.

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We'll create another anchor tag or link.

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And we'll say that links to cupcakes and prices.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We'll create another link.

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And that will go to locations or places where you might find

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
a Smells Like Bakin' bakery.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Lastly, we'll create a contact page.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like I said, we'll learn more about links later on,

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but for now just type it exactly as you see it.

138
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Next, we need to add a few attributes that we'll use 

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to select these elements with our CSS later on.

140
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In this case, we're going to apply what are called class attributes.

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So, next to my unordered list where it opens up

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll type &quot;class,&quot; an equal sign, some quotes, 

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and then I'm going to type the word &quot;nav.&quot;

144
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That way when I'm styling this with my CSS,

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll be able to identify this particular unordered list as the navigation.

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then on my last list item I'm going to type the class &quot;last.&quot;

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
These classes are not predefined.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can go ahead and name a class whatever you want and then refer to it later.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's just an easy way of identifying things in your HTML with your CSS.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If that doesn't make any sense, don't worry.

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It will when we move on to CSS.

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
With our navigation created as an unordered list,

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
let's go ahead and save.

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We'll switch back to the browser and refresh,

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and as you can see we now have a list of links.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We just learned a ton of HTML, and there's still more to go.

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
However, before we continue, let's stop for a minute 

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to review some of the things that we've learned.
